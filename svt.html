                </ul>
            <br>
                Jun aka Wen Junhui was born on June 10, 1996 in Guangdong, China. 
                His Korean name is Wen Junhui. In the group, Jun plays as lead dancer and sub-vocalist. 
                Jun's face looks similar to Super Junior's Heechul and Heechul even admitted this himself. 
                Just like most students in China who like K-Pop, 
                Jun did the same and decided to move to Korea so he could finally make his debut like he is today.<br>
                <br>
                Before moving to Korea, Jun was a child actor and appeared in the legendary film The Legend is Born - Ip Man, as the young IP Man. 
                Therefore, Jun is good at Wushu and Kung Fu martial arts. 
                He can also speak 3 languages, namely Mandarin, Cantonese and Korean.<br>
                <br>
                
                When he was 2 years old, Jun's parents divorced and he moved in with his mother. 
                Then when he was 8 years old, Mrs. Jun remarried and had one half-brother. 
                The funny thing is, Jun sometimes sleeps with his eyes open which of course makes the other members feel scared if they happen to pass by. 
                Jun's role models are two Super Junior M members, namely Zhoumi and Henry, 
                because he also wants to receive a lot of support from China and Korea like the two senior idols.</p>

                Mingyu showed his skills in catching fish, cooking and building a house. 
                Even Seventeen's colleagues always rely on Mingyu when living together. 
                Mingyu once tested his acting skills by making a cameo in the Thai comedy series Luangta Mahachon. 
                In 2020, Mingyu and Seungkwan took a walk in Menteng Park, Jakarta. 
                The Indonesian Carats did not expect this, especially since their appearance looked like local residents who even played volleyball. 
                This was part of INSIDE Seventeen when they were holding their concert in Jakarta.</p>

                Even fans are often surprised because of their interactions with many senior to rookie idols, also known as Social Butterflies.<br>
                <br>
                Seungkwan has been a trainee since 2012. Previously, Seungkwan was also offered to join JYP Entertainment, 
                but he rejected the offer. Since elementary school, Seungkwan has always participated in children's song festivals and never thought about becoming a singer. 
                Then, one of his teachers recorded Seungkwan's performance and uploaded it to the internet, 
                giving Seungkwan the opportunity to audition for Pledis Entertainment.<br>
                <br>
                Seungkwan's good behavior was not only felt by senior and rookie idols, but also journalists. 
                Once, Seungkwan distributed tangerines to journalists at 5 am without anyone asking. 
                Therefore, Seungkwan is always hailed as a good role model, especially for teenagers. 
                He even won an award in the Rookie Entertainer Award category in 2018.</p>
