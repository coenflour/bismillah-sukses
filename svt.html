            <p>Rather than being buried in endless negative thoughts in bad situations, Seventeen understands the conflict and wandering of youth from a healthy and positive perspective, saying, 'Instead of being pessimistic and frustrated on our own, let's fight and overcome together without getting tired,' and send a message of comfort and hope to them. presents..</p>
