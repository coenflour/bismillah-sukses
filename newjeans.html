            <h2>NewJeans 'Super Shy'</h2>
            <p>"Super Shy" is a bubblegum Jersey club anthem about the nervousness and awkwardness when confessing feelings to a love interest for the first time. ADOR, through YG Plus, released the track as the lead single from NewJeans' second EP, Get Up, on July 7, 2023..</p>
            <p>The NewJeans quintet navigate between rap breakdowns and heartfelt yearning, jointly battling their own shyness. As they stand face to face with the object of their affection, they become acutely aware of their own bashful nature. Nonetheless, they still determine to make a move and wholeheartedly pursue the boy they adore.</p>
            <p>NewJeans' songs often explore the desire to confess heartfelt emotions to their beloved, even in the face of fear or uncertainty. In their track "Ditto," the girls find themselves deeply immersed in love, yet uncertain if their affections are mirrored in return. On the other hand, "OMG" captures the euphoric rush of emotions experienced when completely smitten.</p>
