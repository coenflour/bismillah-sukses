                <br>
                In July 2022, this girl group was introduced to the public accompanied by the release of a pre-debut single entitled "Attention".
                Even though it is classified as an "introductory" song, the single received attention from the public.<br>
                <br>
                Then, on August 1 of the same year, New Jeans released a mini album entitled New Jeans.
                Who would have thought, this mini album also reaped various achievements, one of which was the song entitled "OMG" which successfully topped the Billboard charts on the Hot 100.
                Previously, the single entitled "Ditto" also won Perfect All Kill (PAK), which is the highest title whose song managed to dominate all daily, weekly and real-time charts.

            Even when he sat up, Hanni could still sleep soundly.
